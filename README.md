[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dca05ea0-d734-47ca-a84b-fb0cfee80c5a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/chuck-says/deploys)

This is a basic app that displays a modal with a quote pulled from the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). It was created in the DigitalCrafts bootcamp. We used HTML & CSS with very basic stying. It is also deployed on Netlify. You can view the live site [here](https://chuck-says.netlify.app/).
